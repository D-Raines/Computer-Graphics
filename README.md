***How do I approach designing software?***

After working on this assignment, I have to reevaluate my approach on designing software. The way I was doing it was to formulate a plan and stick to it. Now, I’m seeing that when time constraints take precedent that I have to be more flexible. Instead of defining the steps how something will be done, it is more important to be flexible and define the end goal. That way, there can be numerous paths to take to get to the finish line and the path of least resistance is more important when time is of the essence.


***What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?***

The new design skills that were added to my repertoire include the ability to look at objects and see that they can be made up of multiple shapes, and not just specific ones. For example, an hourglass can be made with cones or with pyramids. By being able to see that there are options, there is a new way of thinking when looking at rendered objects.

***What design process did you follow for your project work?***

The design process I followed was to look at objects as if they were made up of a bunch of small shapes. By seeing what shapes make up the objects, and looking for the most common ones first, several larger objects could be rendered in the same mesh to simplify the design process.


***How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?***

The main tactic, or biggest learning lesson, is to use deductive strategies for choosing a gambit to accomplish goals. For example, by knowing how a finish project should look and then coming up with multiple was to finish the project using sequential and parallel steps.


***How do I approach developing programs?***

I approach developing programs with clearly defined, finished products, and work backwards. There is always more than one way to do something, so having a plan B is essential, because you never know when a personal matter is going to come up and you might lose a few weeks of your time.


***What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?***

The new development strategy I acquired while working on the 3D scene was to see general shapes, such as triangles and circles, and combine them to make more complex 3D objects. I have never been an artist, so learning to see things different in that context is an appreciated strategy.


***How did iteration factor into your development?***

Iteration factored into my development when I created functions to render shapes and used parameters to change those shapes’ sizes and locations on the 3D map of different objects.

***How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?***
My approach to development evolved throughout the milestones by going over every line of the tutorials that showed how to render cubes with different techniques and visual displays. By having an example, I was able to make steps to incorporate those same techniques in the milestones.


***How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?***

Computer science will help me reach my goals by acquiring new information, documenting it, experimenting with its applications, and using the information like a tool to solve problems. Computer science is a process on learning how to think more efficiently and effectively.


***How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?***

Computer graphics and visualizations has opened the door in seeing how things can be built multiple ways. In my past life, in construction, I would build things in a systematic way and there wasn’t much flexibility because there were other crews that needed you out of the way, which didn’t leave time to be creative or deviate. Computer graphics has made it possible to look at things differently and see the processes that can be used to build things out using both sequential and parallel task.


***How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?***

In much the same way as facilitating new skills for educational endeavors, the skills gained from computer graphics, such as scheduling task to be done in parallel, will allow for future opportunities to be accomplished ahead of schedule and under budget.
